# Community Models

Community model ports live under `community_models` to make the ownership boundary clear while keeping them available through the normal audio.cpp CLI and server paths.

The review bar for community models is intentionally lighter than core model integrations, so contributors can share useful ports earlier. They should still meet these practical expectations:

- RTF should be below 1.0.
- VRAM usage should stay stable across multiple requests. If memory needs to be optimized, use `mem_saver` to balance performance and VRAM instead of hiding leaks.
- Long-form generation should work correctly. The shared long-form TTS/clone test cases live in `tools/audiocpp_cli/audiocpp_cli_longform_tts_clone_cases.json`.
- Use existing framework modules and patterns as much as possible.
